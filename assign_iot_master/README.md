1. Type of IDE: platform IO and Visual Studio Code SW
2. Choose the appropriate environment for the board. In this Lab, I have used Yolo Uno, with some features listed in the platformio.ini file in link GitHub.
3. The next step, build and upload code to the ESP32 coreS3
   board. When encountering some errors or issues, so push the “reset” button to run
   again the program and monitor serial console.
4. The final step, monitor the change of humidity and temperature
   on server Core IoT.
